            <h2>What is Mean ?</h2>
<p> <span style="color:#ff0000;font-weight:bold;">Mean</span> is just another name for average. To find the mean of a data set, add all the values together and divide by the number of values in the set. The result is  mean!</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;margin-top:20px;">Examples</h2>

<select name="mean-data" id="datasetSelector">

    <div class="example-info cricket">
        <p>A cricketer scores the following runs in eight innings:
            58, 76, 40, 35, 46, 45, 20, 100.
        <br>
        Total number of innings = 8 <br>
        Total score = 58+76+40+35+46+45+20+100=420 <br >
        So , Mean = Total Score / Total no. of innings 
        => 420 / 8 = 52.5
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="example-info temperature">
        <p>The daily february temperatures for 10 days are listed for a certain city. <br>
            Temperatures are : 20,21,22,24,25,26,27,29,37,37
            <br>
            Total days = 10 <br>
            Total Temperature = 20+21+22+24+25+26+27+29+37+37=268 <br >
            So , Mean = Total Temperature / Total days 
            => 268 / 10 = 26.8
            </p>

    <div class="example-info heights">
        <p>There are 5 trees in Terry’s front yard. He measures each tree to find out how tall it is in inches and writes the measurement on a sheet of paper. This is Terry’s list: 98, 94, 41, 96, and 11. What is the average height of a tree in Terry’s front yard?
        <br>
        Total number of Trees = 5 <br>
        Total height = 98+94+41+96+11=400 <br >
        So , Mean = Total height / Total no. of trees 
        => 400 / 8 = 50

   <div class="conclusion">
<p>    Whenever a graph falls on a normal distribution, using the mean is a good choice. But if data has extreme scores (such as the difference between a millionaire and someone making 30,000 a year), you will need to look at <a style="color:#00ff96;text-decoration: none;" href="../pages/median.html">median</a>, because you’ll find a much more representative number for your sample.
