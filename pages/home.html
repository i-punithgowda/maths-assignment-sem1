<p>
    A <span style="color:#ff0000;font-weight: bold;">central tendency</span> is a single value or average that represents the whole set of data. It is referred to as the central location of data distribution. The value that is represented as a central tendency is within the range of the data. 
<br>
<br> It lets us know what is normal or 'average' for a set of data. It also condenses the data set down to one representative value, which is useful when you are working with large amounts of data. <br> There are 3 measures of central tendency.
