            <h2>What is Median ?</h2>
            <p> <span style="color:#ff0000;font-weight:bold;">Median</span> is a statistical measure that determines the middle value of a dataset listed in ascending order (i.e., from smallest to largest value). The measure divides the lower half from the higher half of the dataset , then the central value is called median.</p>

<div class="example-info cricket">
    <p>Marks of 11 students in class 10 in a subject are given as : 35 , 40 , 38 , 17 , 25 , 45 , 36 , 29 , 42 , 22
    <br>
    Total number of students = 10 <br>
    Marks after sorting = 17, 22, 25, 29, 35, 36, 38, 40, 42, 45 , 100 <br >
    So , Median = (n+1)th term in sorted array
    => (11+1)/2<sup>th</sup> term = 12/2=6<sup>th</sup> term
    <br> i.e Median = 36 
    </p>

<div class="example-info temperature">
    <p>
        5 houses are sold for the following amounts: 25000, 29000, 15900, 27000, and 27000. 
    <br>
    Total number of Houses = 10 <br>
    Cost after sorting = 15900,25000,27000,29000,30300 <br >
    So , Median = (n+1)th term in sorted array
    => (5+1)/2<sup>th</sup> term = 6/2=3<sup>rd</sup> term
    <br> i.e Median = 27
Where as mean would be 53.4 , in such cases 27 is better representation of data than 53.

<div class="conclusion">
    <p>
     In some cases medians can give better result when data consists of outliers because result of medians are not affected by outliers, 
The middle (median) remains the same middle value regardless of the size of the highest or the lowest case, which has great effects on the average.
